# Heart Disease Classification

This project develops an end-to-end machine learning classification model to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on medical attributes.  
The dataset contains features such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other clinical indicators.  

Key highlights:
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and correlations in medical data.  
- Preprocessed data with scaling, encoding, and feature selection.  
- Trained and evaluated multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.) using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.  
- Built an end-to-end pipeline for reproducibility.
